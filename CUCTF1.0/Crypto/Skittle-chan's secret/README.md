After I pinged skittle-chan(bot) in the discord, I got first hint of the challenge.

That hint was referring to Base64. So, I used Cyberchef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode from Base64.

`$sudo heck heckur`


That was sent to skittle-chan. Then, I got the second hint of the challenge.

This time the hint was refering to ROT13. So, I used the Cyberchef again to decode with ROT13.

This time the hint was refering to Vigenere. So, I used Cyberchef again to decode the Vigenere using 'Beluga' as key.

`CUCTF{Skittle_loves_begugla_coz_begula_is_the_best}`

That was the flag that was needed to be submitted.
